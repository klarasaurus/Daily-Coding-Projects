    <h3>Project 2</h3>
    <p>
      This is my second project. I just copied project 1 and pasted it into this
      prjoect, so I can continue working on it :)
    </p>
    <p>I also had to add a link to this project in my Homepage</p>
    <p>
      From now on, I will probably start looking through old notes that I´ve
      taken throughout my Web Development Course and display them in my notes.
      This will both advance my coding skills as well as a little refresher in
      memory
