    <p>
      This is the html-file to the main project, where I will constantly update
      the content with either a new Project or a new Day Challange.

      The goal with this project is to get into the flow of coding everday,
      which will enhance my learning by practicing coding every day

      As I continue to learn and advance my projects, I will also update this
      main page to improve the looks and content - Enjoy!
